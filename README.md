# Welcome to Time Scheduler ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Some dependencies may refuse to install. Use npx expo install package-name to select a version that works with your current Expo SDK version:

   ```bash
   npx expo install @react-navigation/material-top-tabs
   ```

   In case that fails. Add the --force flag to npm:

   ```bash
   npm install --force
   ```

2. Start the app(using development build) and choose the platform to view it: Options are Android, iOS simulator and web.

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   Or

   ```bash
   npx expo start -c  # -c clears the cache
   ```

   In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

   - development build
   - Android emulator
   - iOS simulator
   - Expo Go

   Enter i to select iOS simulator

   This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

3. Run unit tests

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```  

## Run on iOS device

1. First, generate native iOS directories using Prebuild

   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   ```

2. When you're ready, plugin your iPhone via USB to your laptop, and run:

   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios --device
   ```

   This command will compile the native iOS app locally, setup CocoaPos, create a build and a connection with your IOS device.

3. In case you run into iOS dependency issues run this command to reinstall the pos afresh

   ```bash
   pod install --repo-update
   ```

4. Diagnose issues with the app

   ```bash
   npx expo-doctor
   ```
 
## Limitations
1. The unit tests pass except for Google Authentication, and AsyncStorage
2. The Google Login and Push notifications only work on an actual iOS device

## Notes on my approach.
1. I opted to create simple date picker to demonstrate my skills
2. I included many tests in the unit tests to increase the test scope
3. I included a button to send push notifications to save you the waiting time
4. I used Zustand with AsyncStorage simply because they are faster and less boiler plate for a small app
5. I used Tailwind to enhance the look of the app - though it has colour limitations for iOS
6. I used a custom button, that I use in my other projects because it looks better has more room for props
7. Some code(like Button) is borrowed from my existing projects at the moment
8. I opted to avoid BottomSheet due to complications with iOS versions
